# ML_notebooks

 *This repo has notebooks which I created while understanding about the Linear-Regression and Random-Forest-Classifier using Scikit-Learn library.
 *The Decision_Tree notebook basically is an implementation of a single decision tree and then an ensemble of trees(Random Forest Classifier) on a Kaggle dataset
 *The accuracy on the test dataset is about 84% :/.
